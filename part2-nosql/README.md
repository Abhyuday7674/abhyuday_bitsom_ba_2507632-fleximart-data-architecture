# Part 2: NoSQL Database Analysis (MongoDB)

## Overview
This part of the project focuses on analyzing and implementing a NoSQL database solution using MongoDB for FlexiMart’s diverse product catalog. MongoDB is evaluated as an alternative to relational databases due to its flexible schema, support for nested data, and scalability.

Part 2 is divided into two sections:
- Task 2.1: NoSQL Justification (Theory)
- Task 2.2: MongoDB Implementation (Practical)

## Task 2.1: NoSQL Justification (Theory)

This task explains why a traditional relational database (RDBMS) is not ideal for handling highly diverse product data and how MongoDB solves these challenges.

Key topics covered:
- Limitations of RDBMS with varying product attributes
- Issues with frequent schema changes
- Difficulty storing nested data like customer reviews
- Benefits of MongoDB such as flexible schema, embedded documents, and horizontal scalability
- Trade-offs of using MongoDB instead of MySQL

## Task 2.2: MongoDB Implementation (Practical)

This task demonstrates practical MongoDB operations using a real-world product catalog dataset.

### Dataset
- File: products_catalog.json
- Contains 12 products across Electronics and Fashion categories
- Includes nested specifications, embedded reviews, pricing, stock, tags, and warranty details

### MongoDB Operations
All required MongoDB operations are implemented with proper comments in the file below:

File:
- mongodb_operations.js

Operations included:
1. Loading JSON data into the products collection
2. Querying Electronics products below a given price
3. Calculating average product ratings using aggregation
4. Updating a product by adding a new review
5. Performing complex aggregation to calculate average price by category
